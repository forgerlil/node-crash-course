Changes:

1. We moved our middleware to be applied to all routes through the .use method.
2. By making use of the .route() method, we can apply many types of request to the same path in a much more concise way.
3. We created a folder, controllers, where all the files that have controller functions will be stored.
4. We limited our endpoints to respond to specific types of request, and set up a few more endpoints and controller functions.
